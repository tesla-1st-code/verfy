Verfy is an experimental app to replace your username-password login system with a biometric one.
Verfy allows you to login without typing any username and password instead processing the spoken keyword.

There are 2 authentication steps:
1. authenticating the correct user based on their voice
2. authenticating the spoken keyword

if user passes those 2 steps, so it is considered as an authenticated one.
